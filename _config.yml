course_name: Machine Learning
course_description: "Machine Learning has recently become one of the most essential subjects in modern research and development, and it often serves as a foundational step in any roadmap toward Artificial Intelligence (AI).
This course familiarizes students with key concepts and a variety of algorithms used for classification and clustering. Students will not only learn the theoretical principles behind these algorithms but also gain an intuitive understanding of how and why they work through practical examples and exercises.

This graduate-level course offers an in-depth exploration of machine learning methods, emphasizing both theoretical foundations and advanced algorithmic design. The course introduces the probabilistic foundations of machine learning through Bayesian inference, MLE, and MAP estimation, followed by key supervised methods such as regression, decision trees, SVMs, and Parzen windows. Students then explore ensemble learning, model selection, and dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and LDA. The final part covers unsupervised learning, including clustering, mixture models, and the EM algorithm. Through lectures, assignments, and a final project, students gain practical experience in implementing and evaluating these methods using Python."
